A Pythagorean cup, also known as a Greedy Cup or a Tantalus cup, is a novelty drinking vessel with an interesting mechanism designed to prevent excessive consumption of liquid.
It's attributed to the ancient Greek mathematician Pythagoras.The cup operates on the principle of siphon action. It has a column in the center that extends from the bottom to 
near the top of the cup. This column has a small hole near the top and a larger hole at the bottom. When the cup is filled with liquid, the liquid level rises above the small hole, 
creating a siphon effect that drains the cup through the bottom hole. However, if someone tries to overfill the cup, causing the liquid level to rise above a certain point, the siphon 
action reverses, and all the liquid drains out of the cup through the bottom hole, preventing the person from drinking more than a certain amount.
