A Klein bottle is a non-orientable surface, meaning it has only one side. It's a mathematical concept in topology, discovered by the German mathematician Felix Klein in the late 19th century.
This is a surface where if you were an ant walking on it, you would eventually end up on the other side without ever crossing an edge.While a true Klein bottle cannot be physically 
constructed in three-dimensional space without self-intersections, it's a fascinating object in mathematics and is often studied for its properties related to topology and geometry.
